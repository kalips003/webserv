1. PROCESS CONTROL
============================================================

    Executes a new program in the current process (used for CGI).
    Replaces current process image with new executable.

waitpid()           - C / POSIX
    Waits for a specific child process to terminate (reap CGI child).

kill()              - C / POSIX
    Sends a signal to a process (e.g., SIGTERM).
    May be used to terminate CGI on timeout.

signal()            - C / POSIX
    Sets signal handler (e.g., ignore SIGPIPE to prevent crash on closed socket).


============================================================
2. FILE DESCRIPTORS AND GENERAL I/O
============================================================

open()              - C / POSIX
    Opens a file, returns file descriptor.

close()             - C / POSIX
    Closes an open file descriptor.

read()              - C / POSIX
    Reads from file descriptor (must only be done after readiness via poll/select).

    Writes to file descriptor (must only be done after readiness).

dup()               - C / POSIX
    Duplicates a file descriptor.

dup2()              - C / POSIX
    Duplicates FD to a specific target descriptor (used for CGI redirection).

    Controls file descriptor flags.
    Allowed flags: F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK, FD_CLOEXEC.

pipe()              - C / POSIX
    Creates a pair of connected file descriptors.
    Used for interprocess communication (e.g., CGI stdin/stdout).

access()            - C / POSIX
    Checks file existence or permission.

stat()              - C / POSIX
    Retrieves file status (size, type, modification time).

opendir()           - C / POSIX
    Opens a directory stream.

readdir()           - C / POSIX
    Reads directory entries.

closedir()          - C / POSIX
    Closes directory stream.


============================================================
3. SOCKET PROGRAMMING:
    Server Workflow

socket() → create a listening socket.
setsockopt() (optional) → configure options like SO_REUSEADDR.
bind() → assign an IP address and port to the socket.
listen() → mark the socket as passive to accept incoming connections.
accept() → accept a client connection; returns a new socket FD for communication.
recv() / send() → exchange data with the client.
close() → close the client socket; optionally continue to accept more clients.
close() → close the listening socket when shutting down.

    Client Workflow

socket() → create a socket for outgoing connection.
connect() → connect to the server's IP and port.
send() / recv() → exchange data with the server.
close() → close the connection when done.
============================================================

socket()            - C / POSIX
    Creates a new socket descriptor.

bind()              - C / POSIX
    Binds socket to address and port.

listen()            - C / POSIX
    Marks socket as passive (ready to accept).

accept()            - C / POSIX
    Accepts incoming connection (returns new socket FD).
    Must be non-blocking.

connect()           - C / POSIX
    Connects socket to remote address (rarely used here).

send()              - C / POSIX
    Sends data on socket (after writable event).

recv()              - C / POSIX
    Receives data from socket (after readable event).

setsockopt()        - C / POSIX
    Configures socket options (e.g., SO_REUSEADDR).

getsockname()       - C / POSIX
    Gets local address info of socket.

getaddrinfo()       - C / POSIX
    Resolves hostname/service to address info.

freeaddrinfo()      - C / POSIX
    Frees memory from getaddrinfo().

getprotobyname()    - C / POSIX
    Gets protocol info by name ("tcp", "udp", etc.).

htons(), htonl()    - C / POSIX
    Host to network byte order conversion (short/long).

ntohs(), ntohl()    - C / POSIX
    Network to host byte order conversion.

socketpair()        - C / POSIX
    Creates a pair of connected sockets (like pipe()).


============================================================
4. EVENT MULTIPLEXING (NON-BLOCKING I/O CORE)
============================================================

poll()              - C / POSIX
    Monitors multiple FDs for readiness (read/write).

select()            - C / POSIX
    Alternative to poll(), uses FD_SET macros.

epoll_create()      - C / Linux
    Creates epoll instance (Linux only).

epoll_ctl()         - C / Linux
    Controls epoll (add/remove/modify monitored FDs).

epoll_wait()        - C / Linux
    Waits for events on epoll instance.

kqueue()            - C / BSD / macOS
    Creates a kqueue event notification interface.

kevent()            - C / BSD / macOS
    Waits for or submits events to kqueue.


============================================================
5. ENVIRONMENT AND ERROR HANDLING
============================================================

strerror()          - C / POSIX

errno               - C / POSIX

============================================================
6. MISCELLANEOUS
============================================================

chdir()             - C / POSIX
    Changes current working directory (used before execve in CGI).

7. C++ 98 STANDARD LIBRARY (ALLOWED)
============================================================

- std::string, std::map, std::vector, std::deque, std::list
- std::ifstream, std::ofstream, std::ostringstream, std::istringstream
- std::exception, std::runtime_error
- iostream, sstream, algorithm, utility, iomanip
- new, delete
- STL containers and algorithms from C++98 (no C++11 features)

Used for: configuration parsing, data storage, logic structuring, error handling.


============================================================
NOTES
============================================================

- All listed functions are POSIX C system calls.
- All networking and I/O must use non-blocking mode.
- All I/O readiness must be driven by a single poll()/select()/epoll()/kqueue().
- Never rely on errno after read/write.
- fork() allowed only for CGI execution.
- Implementation language: C++98.
- System interaction: C POSIX API.
