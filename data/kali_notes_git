git checkout -b my_branch

is short for:

git branch my_branch   # create the branch
git checkout my_branch # move into it



-u (used with git push)

Meaning: “set the upstream (tracking) branch.”

git push -u origin my_branch
does two things:

Pushes your branch to the remote (GitHub).
Links your local my_branch to the remote origin/my_branch.
After that, you can simply run git push or git pull — no need to specify branch names again.
